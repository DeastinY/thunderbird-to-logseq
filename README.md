# 📨 Thunderbird to Logseq

> I use logseq for most of my work notes and often found myself copy-pasting content from mails. There does not seem to be a nice standard for linking to messages in Thunderbird, so I decided to instead add the mails into my notes directly. This script automates the process and does some basic processing.

This Python script reads emails directly from Thunderbird's internal **mbox** format and exports them as individual Markdown files tailored for use with [Logseq](https://logseq.com).

## ✨ Features

- 📁 Parses Thunderbird `.mbox` files directly
- 📅 Converts email dates into Logseq-compatible `[[YYYY-MM-DD]]` links
- 🧠 Formats names like `Surname, Forename` into `[[Forename Surname]]`
- ⚡ Creates a cache (`.exported_emails_cache`) to avoid duplicate exports
- 🛠️ Simple and easily customizable Python code

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youruser/thunderbird-to-logseq.git
   cd thunderbird-to-logseq
   ```

2. **Run the script manually to test it**

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

   > Adjust paths in the script to your Thunderbird profile and Logseq destination folder.

## 🔁 Automate with Scheduled Jobs

### 🕰️ Option 1: Using `cron` (Traditional)

To run the script every 15 minutes:

1. Edit your crontab:

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add the following line:

   ```cron
   */15 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/thunderbird_to_logseq.py
   ```
### ⚙️ Option 2: Using `systemd` (Recommended on Arch & modern Linux)

#### 1. Create a systemd service

Save as `~/.config/systemd/user/thunderbird-to-logseq.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Sync Thunderbird MBox to Logseq

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/user/tb2logseq/main.py
```

#### 2. Create a systemd timer

Save as `~/.config/systemd/user/thunderbird-to-logseq.timer`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Run Thunderbird to Logseq sync every 5 minutes

[Timer]
OnBootSec=5min
OnUnitActiveSec=5min
Unit=thunderbird-to-logseq.service

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

#### 3. Enable and start the timer

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now thunderbird-to-logseq.timer
```

Check timer status:

```bash
systemctl --user list-timers
```
